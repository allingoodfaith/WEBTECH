This was quite the refresh of my skills in web building. I did up going back to W3 schools to get some help for this and I will likely be doing so throughout the rest of the class. 
I tried making the hero image work but it didn't really work as i would of wanted. I still kept the code and image in but just commented it out. I think I know where it went wrong mostly being that I was struggling to get the image linkk to work. 

I hope this class will go well but you and I both know I struggle with code so we shall see. I might pop in to get some help as usual.
